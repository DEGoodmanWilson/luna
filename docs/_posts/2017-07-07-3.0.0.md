-- Because the 404 is the centerpiece of your brand, you can now more easily supply your own custom 404 pages, and other error pages too. 👷‍♀️
-- The logging system was a logjam. A logjam on fire. A jam fire, if you will. Now it is less so. 🚒
-- Added a mechanism to support optional in-memory cacheing of objects served from the disk. Done well, this can offer a 400% speed-up! Tried to make the interface as simple as possible to use. That said, cache invalidation is on you 😘 
-- Who knew, apparently we were not correctly handling IP address strings. Happens to the best! And also to us. 😳
-- The examples provided are now cleaner, neater, clearer, and documented.
-- More testing added to increase coverage. Decreased indeterminism in some of the tests.
-- GCC 4.9 support is on its last legs, TBH.
-- So, looking to the future, we fixed GCC 5 tests, and added GCC 6 tests, to ensure compatibility. Yes, it is compatible.
