Holy shit, here's some breaking changes for you.

There's a lot going on in the API whose use is just questionable at best, so some cruft has been removed:
- Removed all existing middleware
- Removed all existing error handling callbacks
- Removed the ability to remove request handlers (because, really, why is that necessary?)
- All request handling has been moved to a new `router` class for increased flexibility.
