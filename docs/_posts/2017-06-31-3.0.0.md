-- Because the 404 is the centerpiece of your brand, you can now more easily supply your own custom 404 pages, and other error pages too.
-- The logging system was a logjam. A logjam on fire. A jam fire, if you will. Now it is less so.
-- Who knew, apparently we were not correctly handling IP address strings. Happens to the best of us!
-- The examples provided are now cleaner, neater, clearer, and documented.
-- More testing added to increase coverage. Decreased indeterminism in some of the tests.
