- `luna::server::await()` is now the best way to wait for a server to stop.
- You can now choose not to start the server at construction time, instead calling `luna::server::start()`
  to start the server. Just pass `luna::server::start_on_construction{false}` to the `luna::server` constructor.
- You can now also choose to stop the server at will with `luna::server::stop()`.
