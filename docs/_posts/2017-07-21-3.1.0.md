- I suppose the changes to the logger are technically a breaking change. Now you get the server's response too.
- Now, if you are serving files, and someone requests a directory, and you have an index.html, we serve that index.html automatically
- Mime types for CSS and JavaScript files were incorrectly deduced. Now they are mostly correctly deduced.
- Some minor internal fixes that you will never ever possibly notice, honestly. They are more for my peace of mind than anything.
