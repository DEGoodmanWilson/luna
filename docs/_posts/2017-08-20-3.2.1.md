- Oh, what, poll isn't working for some reason on Macs. Switched to using select as default. Performance is now much better. You can get poll behavior by using the `use_epoll_if_available` option.
- There's been a good bit of behind-the-scenes work making things cleaner, more maintainable, and ready for some planned improvements.
